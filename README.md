# Hello-World
GitHub Training
Making a Branch of the Master to the Hello World Training.  My name is Ravesh, and I like electronics and machines.  I also want to one day level up to a half-man/half-octopus hybrid.  The manctopus as it were.  I've always wanted to shoot ink at my arch-enemies, but till now I've had to rely on my friends at PaperMate for my artillery.  But no more!  Soon, I shall vanquish all those who cross me with a shot of ink straight in the eye. PEW PEW PEW!!!!MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!   But like any true anti-hero, I also have a kind side.  I'll be sure to offer a helping tentacle to any suffering lifeform.  I am not for sale, and you may not adopt me as a pet.  

Have a good day, inferior vertebrate.
